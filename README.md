# Deep Learning Tasks Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Tasks Repository**! This collection represents an ongoing exploration of various deep learning concepts and applications. The repository covers a range of topics, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of deep learning techniques and their practical implications.

## Course Objectives

### 1. Why Deep Learning?

Understanding the fundamental motivations and principles behind deep learning, exploring its significance in modern machine learning.

### 2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Investigating the architecture and applications of RNNs, which are particularly suited for sequential data and time-series analysis.

### 3. Convolution Neural Network (CNN)

Exploring CNNs, designed for efficient image recognition and classification tasks through the use of convolutional layers.

### 4. Generative Models

Studying generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), for generating new data instances.

### 5. Attention Mechanism

Understanding attention mechanisms, a crucial component in improving the performance of deep learning models on tasks such as image captioning and machine translation.

### 6. Deep Reinforcement Learning

Delving into the combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning, focusing on agents that learn to make decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

### 7. Evidential Deep Learning

Exploring evidential deep learning, a framework that provides uncertainty estimates along with predictions, essential for decision-making in uncertain environments.

### 8. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)

Investigating RBMs, a type of generative stochastic artificial neural network used for dimensionality reduction, classification, collaborative filtering, feature learning, and topic modelling.

## Ongoing Development

This repository is a work in progress, with new tasks and insights continuously being added. The exploration into deep learning is ongoing, and updates will be made regularly. Contributions, suggestions, and collaborations are welcome! Feel free to explore specific topics and provide feedback.

**Note:** This repository is actively being developed and is not yet finalized.
